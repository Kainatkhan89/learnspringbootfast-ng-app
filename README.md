# learningspringbootfast.com Angular Application

This is the Angular repository of Kainat Khan's full-stack portfolio project built with Angular and Spring Boot.

Please find the Spring Boot back-end repository at: [Spring Boot Repo](https://github.com/Kainatkhan89/learnspringbootfast-web-services).

## Why this project?

To solidify and showcase my knowledge of Spring Boot, Angular, UI / UX development, "pseudo-agile" developmnent, all while trying to learn and implement best practices such as test-driven development and SOLID principles that can get overlooked in professional projects due to tight deadlines or lack of team knowledge. 

## Current status

This project is work in progress as I am learning, building, and refactoring at the same time based on my own learning progress.

## To Do:

1. Write Angular Test
2. Use Signals
3. Add Study Resources feature

----

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.1.0.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
